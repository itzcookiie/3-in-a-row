# Tic-Tac-Toe

- Simple Tic Tac Toe game created using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
- Aim is to try and build random projects 
- I wrote down a bunch of projects I wanted to build and this was one of them.

## How to use it

- To be filled out soon...

## Progress so far
- 21/06/2020

Spent 6hrs so far. 70% of the project is done. I wanted to complete this in 4 - 6 hours, which I do believe is a very possible thing. I am happy with my progress so far though.

- Time: 00:20am

It's 00.20am so, yeah but I started doing work from like 10.30 - 11pm the day before. It's Wednesday now. Spent 2 hrs taking us up to 9hrs total time. Going to try a planning session where I just sit down and think on what I am going to do. Usual, I just code away, but I want to try and not code this time and just think/imagine how I am going to finish it off, so I don't get stuck on deciding how to do it. Try make the journey a lot more simpler and smoother.

Side note, kinda random, but I think the key for me to get better at coding is to spend more time learning + learn more about God. I think the first thing will expand my coding pool and help me to see from afar and code at a higher level basically. Learning in this case I think is reading articles, books or just finding a teacher somehow. Maybe youtube or doing exploring on coding as a whole tbh. Or maybe learning how to make games - that sounds fun.

Learning more about God will help as well because that makes me the rest of me. If I learn more about God, everything in my life will get better. It will amplify everything.

I may give myself a deadline, so I don't end up spending forever on this. Or it will be interesting to see how much work I get done within certain time periods, especially when I set myself a deadline.

- Time: 1.02am

Spent 1hr 15mins tryna plan what I am going to do next time I touch this project. I think I will try complete this in the morning. I have 1hr 45mins left of work to do, before I stop and give it a rest. I think I will look at it as completed by then - any more work on it will be extra. I have 3 main tasks to do to have the whole game done as a whole. Then I have some minor clean up duty, extra finishing touches type work to do after.

It would be great to get started on this in the morning, before work, eating a nice bowl of granola, bathed and ready to goooo

Yeah and I need to change SSH keys, so the person who made this project is actually make PRs... I'll do that now then.

### Aims

- Current time spent: 10hrs 15mins
- % of project completed: 80%
