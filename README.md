# Tic-Tac-Toe

- Simple Tic Tac Toe game created using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
- Aim is to try and build random projects 
- I wrote down a bunch of projects I wanted to build and this was one of them.

## How to use it

- Press play, enter a username, press enter and your in!

## Progress so far
- 21/06/2020

Spent 6hrs so far. 70% of the project is done. I wanted to complete this in 4 - 6 hours, which I do believe is a very possible thing. I am happy with my progress so far though.

- Time: 00:20am

It's 00.20am so, yeah but I started doing work from like 10.30 - 11pm the day before. It's Wednesday now. Spent 2 hrs taking us up to 9hrs total time. Going to try a planning session where I just sit down and think on what I am going to do. Usual, I just code away, but I want to try and not code this time and just think/imagine how I am going to finish it off, so I don't get stuck on deciding how to do it. Try make the journey a lot more simpler and smoother.

Side note, kinda random, but I think the key for me to get better at coding is to spend more time learning + learn more about God. I think the first thing will expand my coding pool and help me to see from afar and code at a higher level basically. Learning in this case I think is reading articles, books or just finding a teacher somehow. Maybe youtube or doing exploring on coding as a whole tbh. Or maybe learning how to make games - that sounds fun.

Learning more about God will help as well because that makes me the rest of me. If I learn more about God, everything in my life will get better. It will amplify everything.

I may give myself a deadline, so I don't end up spending forever on this. Or it will be interesting to see how much work I get done within certain time periods, especially when I set myself a deadline.

- Time: 1.02am

Spent 1hr 15mins tryna plan what I am going to do next time I touch this project. I think I will try complete this in the morning. I have 1hr 45mins left of work to do, before I stop and give it a rest. I think I will look at it as completed by then - any more work on it will be extra. I have 3 main tasks to do to have the whole game done as a whole. Then I have some minor clean up duty, extra finishing touches type work to do after.

It would be great to get started on this in the morning, before work, eating a nice bowl of granola, bathed and ready to goooo

Yeah and I need to change SSH keys, so the person who made this project is actually make PRs... I'll do that now then. Should work now?

- Time: 18:23pm

Going to gym w/ Borris now. Spent about 1hr 30mins I think. Taking me to about 12hrs I guess... not good for me at all. Might spend 1 more hr doing this and I will do it to finish, not to critic and play around. Easy to lose myself, but I will spend I think a good hr and it will just be to finish the project, not worry about whether it looks picture perfect or not.

- Time: 9.06pm

Will spend 1 more hour on this and I will get it done in that hour. I will start this at 6am tomo and finish at 7am. Sole objective is to finish and put everything together, linking all the stages.

- Time: 6.53am

I am going to start my project at 7am and finish at 8am. 

- Time: 8.02am

I have finished working on my project now. Any more time I spend on it now will just be for fun or for me to continue to learn. I learnt quite a lot of things during my last 1hr of working on this:

- I need a way of programming in general - think I am starting to see why programming using a paradigm is useful. Because while I was coding, I didn't want to code in a certain way or do things in a certain way because it just didn't feel right. E.g. I wanted to a way to distinguish between the computer's HTML score and the player's HTML score. I was going to add a class to each person, class name being 'player' for player and 'computer' for computer, so I can reference them easily using JS. I didn't want to do that though, because I was like, why am I creating a class name just to reference JS. Isn't there another way of doing this? It didn't feel right to create class names just for JS. Class names should just be used to CSS. Thinking about it now, I think even just coding that way and looking back at it in the end might be a better learning experience for me than to just not do it. Either way, programming paradigms feel kinda important now, so in those situations, I know what to do and I have an approach to doing everything basically
- I work better when I put a time to what I am doing. Otherwise, I just end up lol'ing about
- Working under a time limit also helps me put things into perspective. E.g. I ended up using localStorage to store the username, instead of trying to do the custom solution I was thinking of. I spent quite a bit of time coming up with how to do it my way, but when I was working under a time, I said forget that, I want to finish this project not spend all my time trying out custom solutions. There's no actual reason for me not to use localStorage as well... A lot of my programming feels kinda random when I think about it now. 
- I also think I like programming this way as well because I can focus on functionality and get that working and do UI/design later. If I spent all my time on functionality, maybe it would look a lot prettier now. Because at the end, I wanted to do some UI/design stuff, but I didn't have any time for that. I wanted to get the whole game working, from start to finish instead of adding extra design stuff that didn't really matter at the time.
- Also I spent about 40 - 45mins (around 40mins) trying to get the tally chart scoreboard system to work with JS. That took all my time. Thinking about it now, I am quite happy with that. I got to focus on functionality and that's what I wanted to do. Only thing was that my implementation was mad. I wonder if one needs so much JS to to things. Does code always have to be mega fat?
- Also I didn't eat or listen to music while working. I think it helps to focus more on what I am doing. I wanted to replicate me doing an exam - only thing I can do is drink water or have scrap paper to work things out
- Something that is pretty sick. I think the game looks better without the 1px white border around. But what's sick about that is, the border helped me to position everything. Now when I take the border off, I think it looks better, but the border helped me to put everything together. The border was basically a frame for me to work in and when I was done, I could take off the frame. Having the border means I can put everything where I want it.
